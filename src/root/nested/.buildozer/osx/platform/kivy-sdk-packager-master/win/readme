For example `--dir G:\Python\env\test --pythons py2.7.9_x86,py2.7.9_x64,py3.4.3_x86,py3.4.3_x64` will
create all 4 distributions.

Requirements, 7zip (see --7zip) and for a 64 bit installation git as well.

Generates portable package for usage with kivy. It includes python and MinGW
for 64 and 32 bit platforms. To use, you specify the python versions to build,
paths to MinGW

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --dir DIR             path of dist directory to use for building the
                        portable python, the end result will be output to this
                        directory. Defaults to cwd (G:\Python\libs\kivy-sdk-
                        packager\win).
  --pythons PYTHONS     Comma separated list of the pythons to generate, in
                        the format of `pyversion_arch,pyversion_arch ...`,
                        where version is e.g. 2.7.6 and arch is either x86 or
                        x64. For example: py2.7.8_x86. Download links will
                        automatically be generated from
                        https://www.python.org/ftp/python/.One can also
                        directly specify the binary link using `pyversion_arch
                        :link:MD5,pyversion_arch:link,pyversion_arch...`,
                        where link can be remote or local (MD5 is optional). .
                        If the local link is a python exe, it will be
                        installed to that previously installed python,
                        otherwise it must be a .msi file. if not specified,
                        the current python process exe will be used
                        (py2.7.8_x64:E:\Python27\python.exe).

                        mingw-w64 32-bit .7z file. If not supplied it will
